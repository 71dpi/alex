        <h1>Driving Off-Property Ecommerce Through Design Strategy</h1>

        <div class="tldr-label">TL;DR</div>
        <p class="tldr">Led design strategy for Kroger's off-property ecommerce initiative—creating a scalable playbook and play cards to standardize listings, reduce turnaround, and maintain brand integrity across partners like DoorDash, Instacart, and Uber Eats. The approach improved operational efficiency, increased engagement, and enabled rapid partner rollouts.</p>

        <section>

            <p>As customers migrated to multi-channel shopping, Kroger aimed to meet them on retail aggregators (DoorDash, Uber Eats, Instacart). Off-property processes were fragmented, producing inconsistent customer experiences and operational inefficiencies. A unified playbook was needed to scale execution while preserving brand and commerce quality.</p>
