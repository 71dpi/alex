        <h1>Transforming the Content Authorship Process at Kroger</h1>

        <div class="tldr-label">TL;DR</div>
        <h6>In 2024 Alex mapped Kroger’s content authorship flow for better speed, accuracy, and scale—standardizing, optimizing, and automating the pipeline from merchandising plans to live content. The effort cut redundant steps, aligned cross-functional teams, and produced a future-state blueprint that enabled automation and improved personalization.</h6>

        <section>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Kroger’s digital experience relies on timely, accurate, and engaging content to showcase products, categories, and promotions across web and native channels. The AMP Content Authorship platform is the backbone for this process, but prior to 2024 the workflow was fragmented and manual, lacking a single source of truth and creating delays in publishing at scale.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The existing workflow involved multiple tools and handoffs, creating bottlenecks and increasing the risk of errors. Planning cycles were rigid, making it difficult to respond quickly to market changes. Teams struggled with managing variant complexity across banners (the Kroger family of stores each publishing their own content) and modalities, reducing redundant steps in asset creation and approval, and aligning upstream orchestration with downstream publishing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>In 2024 I led an initiative to map the value stream of content authorship using Lean methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Value Stream Mapping</strong>: Visualized end-to-end flow from merchandising plan to live display to expose waste and bottlenecks.</li>
                <li><strong>SIPOC Analysis</strong>: Defined Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Outputs, and Customers to clarify roles and dependencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Blueprinting</strong>: Captured front-stage and back-stage activities to identify risks and opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These artifacts formed a comprehensive current-state view and guided a future-state design for a more robust, automated platform.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Actions</h2>
            <p>We pursued a three-phase roadmap: Standardize → Optimize → Automate. Initial opportunities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrating MX tool APIs for pricing and promotions.</li>
                <li>Building ETL data pipelines to establish a unified source of truth.</li>
                <li>Introducing a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system for creative assets.</li>
                <li>Streamlining Figma-to-JSON workflows to reduce handoffs and errors.</li>
                <li>Adding CMS task integration for automated ticketing and deployment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also advocated shifting from a push-based content cadence to a pull-based, on-demand model to improve responsiveness and relevance.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process Efficiency Gains:</strong> Reduced redundant steps and manual interventions, accelerating time-to-market for content updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Future-State Blueprint:</strong> Delivered a design to inform build vs. buy decisions for automation and orchestration tooling.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-Team Alignment:</strong> Enabled CX, DX, and Site Production teams to collaborate on a unified roadmap for content authorship optimization.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>The initiative established foundations for automation, improved scalability by reducing variant complexity, and enhanced customer experience through better personalization and adaptive UI capabilities.</p>
