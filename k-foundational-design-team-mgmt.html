        <h1>Leading Kroger's Foundational Product Design Team Through Transformation</h1>

        <div class="tldr-label">TL;DR</div>
        <h6>Managed Kroger's Foundational Design Team through a strategic expansion—shifting from systems architecture to growth-focused point solutions. Built a hybrid, multidisciplinary team that improved personalization, trust, search relevance, and assortment availability while preserving revenue drivers and scaling design delivery.</h6>

        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>As manager of Kroger's Foundational Design Team, I led a multidisciplinary, hybrid group—design architects, user researchers, UX and product designers, plus remote and contractor contributors. This structure allowed us to create system-level foundations while delivering point solutions that drove measurable growth.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why “Foundational Design”?</h2>
            <p>The team owned core domains that form the backbone of digital commerce: assortment & strategy, trust & privacy, personalization, and search. These capabilities were essential to reliably display products and enable customers to shop across touchpoints.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Assortment & Strategy</strong>: Ensuring the right products and categories are available and discoverable.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust & Privacy</strong>: Building confidence in data security and transparency.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Delivering tailored experiences to drive engagement and conversion.</li>
                <li><strong>Search</strong>: Powering product discovery and navigation—the primary entry point for many shoppers.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Team Composition & Hybrid Model</h2>
            <p>Our team combined system thinkers and execution-focused designers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Architects</strong>: Shaped system frameworks and design principles.</li>
                <li><strong>User Researchers</strong>: Drove insights via usability testing and JTBD mapping.</li>
                <li><strong>UX & Product Designers</strong>: Translated strategy into scalable experiences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The hybrid model enabled global talent leverage, remote agility, and in-person collaboration for high-impact work.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Strategic Expansion</h2>
            <p>We expanded from foundational architecture to point solutions that directly influenced product roadmaps and growth metrics—improving personalization, trust, and availability, and lifting add-to-cart (ATC) and engagement through search and curated pathways.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Initiatives</h2>
            <h4>1. Foundational Change</h4>
            <p>Reimagined patterns and layouts across Home, Search, and Browse; prototyped conversational AI search; and built lighthouse prototypes combining trust, personalization, and assortment filtering.</p>

            <h4>2. Agentic Shopping</h4>
            <p>Led agentic commerce explorations—differentiating conversational AI from embedded agent flows—enabling automated cart-building (dietary/budget constraints) and integrating real-time inventory and loyalty personalization.</p>

            <h4>3. Full App Redesign</h4>
            <p>Contributed to Kroger's native app refresh: a food-first experience, simplified navigation, centralized savings & health integrations, and a scalable design system (Citrus/KDS 2.0) for component-based experiences.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Maintaining Revenue Drivers</h2>
            <p>While evolving the product, we safeguarded major revenue channels by optimizing search relevance and running personalization experiments that improved ATC and engagement.</p>
