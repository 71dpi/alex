<h2>Unique emoji-based üòú posts & search üëÄ
</h2>
<p>Concept design for creation, delivery, and discovery of video, image and text content. Branding, brand and UX research, user flow, product and interaction design.</p>
<h2>ü§î Opportunity</h2>
<p>Create a unique content delivery system expanding on existing communication methods. Emoji take on a meaning of their own, contextual to the sender, the viewer, and the tone and timing of the conversation. What if an emoji acted as a container for deeper
    content?
</p>
<p>The feed appears as a stream of emoji only from your connections for a quick vibe check. Not looking to engage in certain mood or topic? Keep scrolling. See something curious? Tap to see more.</p>
<p>Explore the world on a map UI with clusters of posts. Pop in to see commonly used emoji, and engage or bounce. Or, flip the script and type a string of emoji. See where that string is showing up worldwide and see public posts, discovering the deeper meaning
    ascribed by various cultures and groups.</p>
<p>Similar to Live Photos, active emoji are activated by a simple action. Interaction design needs to be accessible and feel natural. By working with available characters, active emoji are easy to understand and fun to expand on. Most frequent users of social
    media and collaborative communication apps develop emoji shorthand naturally. Active emoji take this phenomenon to the next level.</p>
<h2>üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Results</h2>
<p>95% of potential users surveyed across 3 personas expressed a high level of interest and excitement, while a small contingent did admittedly view the idea as ‚ÄúüåΩ corny.‚Äù I disengaged with the team handing off comprehensive UX flows, a brand kit, and basic
    design system for marketing and development, all informed by user prototype testing.</p>
