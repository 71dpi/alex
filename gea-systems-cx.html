<h2>Customer Journey Mapping</h2>
<p>In 2022 I worked closely with cross-functional leadership team in a customer journey mapping and customer experience maturity program. We unpacked <abbr title="Voice of Customer">VOC</abbr> together, and built a journey map showing customer touch points,
    pains, and areas of opportunity. As a result, small teams were formed to work the largest areas of opportunity.

<h2>Program Management & Service Design</h2>
<p>I served as the Lead service designer, researcher and UX strategist for 4 P&Ls, including 3 unique brands, in a cross-functional initiative team focused on customer-facing web applications. Alongside other active initiatives, I orchestrated and executed
    stakeholder and user research, <abbr title="Customer Experience">CX</abbr> workshops, and a prioritization framework for the many problems the team uncovered and wanted to tackle. Key to the sustainment of the initiative was establishing a balanced
    set of customer success metrics and internal KPIs. To handle change management as people were hired and shifted responsibilities to manage this project in the long term, I maintained a weekly action plan and set team cadences to work within. Some
    of my tactical deliverables included ecosystem maps, information architecture, <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> flows, <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> screens, design system components, and an exhaustive set of well defined epics and
    user stories.
</p>
<p>The most impactful aspect of my engagement was bringing stakeholders to the table to see how their customers overlapped. When engaging with a second business within the GE Aerospace portfolio, customers were faced with a similar but different onboarding
    process. Different systems and people backstage needed information that another part of the business already had. Differences in teams, <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning systems">ERPs</abbr>, <abbr title="Customer Relationship Management platforms">CRMs</abbr>,
    and so on led most to ask the customer for their information again, running background checks a second time, and often signing additional contracts. The real problem was that internal complexity was easier to offload to the customer. By the time we
    untangled and rewrote backstage processes we saw customer wait times reduced by days, volume of troubleshooting cases drop, and an overall reduction in case load for internal admins.

<p>Discovery work led to prioritization of the technology team’s focus on developing a web portal foundation, processes to onboard and authenticate companies and users, and creation of standard work for a support team, all of which aims to tie together an
    ecosystem of a dozen applications. One by one, customer-facing experiences are being refreshed with updated flows, brand, and copy that ensure customers get what they need quickly, instill confidence in the system, and utilize shared account management,
    support, and search services. Future iterations of the portals will be driven by prioritization that considers measurable <abbr title="Customer Satisfaction">CSAT</abbr> and <abbr title="Customer Effort Score">CES</abbr> metrics, and internal productivity
    goals to keep the support team from being overburdened.

<p>After disengaging from direct team rhythms about a year after their inception, I continued to coach team members, and I feel my greatest achievement in this initiative is my advocacy for customer and user experience. I look forward to seeing the team
    thrive.
